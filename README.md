Source Code Management (SCM)

Welcome to the source code management (SCM) system for my alx-pre_course project. This document will provide you with an overview of how I manage my source code and how you can contribute to the project.

Version Control System

I use a version control system (VCS) to manage and track my source code. The VCS allows me to keep track of changes made to my code, collaborate with other developers, and roll back to previous versions if needed at any point in time. I use Git as my VCS.

Repository

My source code is stored in a remote repository hosted on Github. The repository is the central location where all the code and other related files are stored. You can access the repository by following the link https://github.com/sam-sny/alx-pre_course.git

Branches

The main branch contains the latest updates on the directory (0x02-git). The main branch also contains the first commit. Inside the 0x02-git directory are directories (c, js) with empty files (c/c_is_fun.c,  js/main.js ,  js/index.js) as well as directory (bash) with two files (bash/alx and bash/school) containing two written lines each which was added and pushed to the remote server with the commit message (Starting to code today, so cool). The version of the code is always in a releasable state. In this project contains a branch called update_script used to create an empty file called bash/98. The branch is also used to update two files (bash/alx and bash/school), this lines were equally added and pushed to the new branch (update_script) with the commit message (My personal work). A quick fix also took place in the main branch, the file (bash/alx) was updated, the directory (js) was deleted. The changes were added and pushed to the origin with the commit message (Hot fix). The main branch contains the latest changes that have been made to the code and are ready to be tested.

Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to my project, you will need to create a fork of the repository and make your changes in your own fork. Once you have made your changes, you will create a pull request to merge your changes back into the main branch. The pull request will be reviewed before it is merged.

Conclusion

In this document, I have provided you with an overview of how I manage my source code using Git and Github. I hope this information will help you understand how to contribute to my project and make the most of our source code management system.
